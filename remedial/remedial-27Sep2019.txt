1. Code Tracing
- Basic python syntax and language
- Do not anyhow whack

2. Recursion, Iteration, Orders of Growth
- Recursion:
=> 1st step: Base case
=> Recursive step
- Iteration:
=> result variable
=> for/while loop
=> return result

3. Higher-Order Function
=> Matching problem
=> Surprise

4. Data Abstraction
=> Decide on a representation to track all the moving parts
==> Has to be tuple
=> Keep in mind that tuples are immutable
